What's the WiFi Password
========================

I made this app as an inside joke with my friends. All of us would always forget the WiFi password for our local Gurdwara, and so we could constantly ask each other what it was. This app syncs it to your phone, so you always have it with you.

The nice thing about this app is that it is easily configurable to sync any type of information. All of the messages the user sees are customizable in strings.xml. The only other thing left to change is the URL to sync with. There isn't much code either, so it should be fairly easy for anyone to use and customize for their own needs.
